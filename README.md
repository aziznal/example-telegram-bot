# Example Telegram Bot

This is a very simple bot that I made by copy-pasting some code from [this website!](https://www.codementor.io/@karandeepbatra/part-1-how-to-create-a-telegram-bot-in-python-in-under-10-minutes-19yfdv4wrq)

It handles the following commands:
- `/start`
- `/help`
- `/ahmed`
- `/ilyas`

and simply repeats anything you say to it outside of those commands.
